# 🏥 SQL Practice

This folder contains my solutions to SQL exercises from [sql-practice.com](https://sql-practice.com), a platform designed to help learners improve their SQL skills through hands-on query problems.

## 🌐 About SQL-Practice.com

- The site offers interactive SQL problems using **two sample databases**:
  1. **Hospital**
  2. **Sales**

- Each database includes a series of questions categorized by difficulty:
  - ✅ Easy
  - 🟡 Medium
  - 🔴 Hard

You write queries directly in the browser, and the system checks the output against expected results — making it ideal for focused practice.
