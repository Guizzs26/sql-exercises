# 📊 SQL Exercises – Practice Across Platforms

This repository contains my personal solutions to SQL practice problems from platforms like [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql). It's organized by platform and difficulty level to track progress and demonstrate mastery of SQL for data analysis and backend development.

Each solution includes clean, readable queries with comments and multiple approaches when applicable — always prioritizing clarity, performance, and idiomatic SQL style.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📚 Strengthen core SQL skills through real-world problems
- 🧪 Experiment with different query strategies and compare results
- 📂 Serve as a public portfolio of SQL proficiency
- 🧠 Reinforce concepts like grouping, filtering, joins, and subqueries

---

## 🧠 Skills Covered

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `DISTINCT`, `ORDER BY`
- Filtering with `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `NOT`
- Aggregations: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- `JOIN`s: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`
- Subqueries: `IN`, `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`
- `CASE` statements
- `UNION`, `EXCEPT`, `INTERSECT`
- `CTEs` (Common Table Expressions)
- `Window Functions`: `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`, `LEAD`
- Basic performance tips (index-aware querying, avoiding `NOT IN` with NULLs etc...)

## 📌 Notes

- No query relies on platform-specific features — most are ANSI SQL-compatible.
- All solutions are written to be **clear first**, and optimized where necessary.
- If a problem allows multiple approaches, I include them as `Solution 1`, `Solution 2`, etc.
